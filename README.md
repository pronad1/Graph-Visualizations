Graph Craft is a web-based tool for visualizing and analyzing graphs. It provides an interactive environment where users can input their graph data in the form of an adjacency matrix and instantly visualize the graph along with various analysis results.


## Features

- Graph Visualization: Input your graph data using an adjacency matrix and visualize the graph in real-time.
- Adjacency Matrix & Linked Representation: View the input adjacency matrix and its linked representation.
- Warshall's Algorithm: Compute and visualize the transitive closure of the graph using Warshall's Algorithm.
- Path Matrix: Compute and visualize the path matrix of the graph.
